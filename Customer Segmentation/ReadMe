In ecommerce companies like online retails, customer segmentation is necessary in order to understand customers behaviors. It leverages aqcuired customer data like the one we have in our case, **transactions data** in order to divide customers into groups. 

Our goal in this Notebook is to cluster our customers to get insights in:
- Increasing **revenue** (Knowing customers who present most of our revenue)
- Increasing customer **retention**
- Discovering **Trends and patterns** 
- Defining **customers at risk**

We will do **RFM Analysis** as a first step and then **combine RFM with predictive algorithms (k-means)**.
